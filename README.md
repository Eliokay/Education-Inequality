# Education-Inequality-and-Socioeconomic-Factors
## Project Description
This project addresses inequality of educational opportunity in U.S. high schools. I will focus on average student performance on the ACT or SAT exams that students take as part of the college application process. I expect a range of school performance on these exams, but I want to know if school performance is predicted by socioeconomic factors.

## Data Description
This project utilizes two data sets EdGap_data.xlsx and ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv. The primary data set is the EdGap data set from [EdGap.org.](https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.892/-95.977) This data set from 2016 includes information about average ACT or SAT scores for schools and several socioeconomic characteristics of the school district. The secondary data set is basic information about each school from the [National Center for Education Statistics.](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp) This data set consists of basic identifying information about schools and can be assumed to be of reasonably high quality.
